				<p>One spring day, at the hour of an unusually hot sunset, two citizens appeared in Moscow, on the Patriarch's Ponds. The first of them, dressed in a summer gray pair, was short, plump, bald, carried his decent hat like a pie in his hand, and on his well-shaven face were supernaturally large glasses with black horn frames. The other was a broad-shouldered, reddish-haired, curly-haired young man with a checkered cap pulled back on his head, wearing a cowboy shirt, chewed-up white trousers, and black slippers.</p>
